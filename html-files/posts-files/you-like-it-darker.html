                    <p class="summary-post"><b>“You like it darker? Fine, so do I,” writes Stephen King in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of life—both metaphorical and literal. King has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. King writes to feel “the exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,” and in You Like It Darker, readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again.</b></p>
                    <p>This book is yet again another short stories collection of short stories written by Stephen King. I gotta say the more of the new books written by Stephen King I read the more I want to downgrade him as my favorite author of all time. Because for me personally his books written after the 1990s doesn’t impress nor do they make me fall in love with them as his books before and during the 1990s does.</p>
                    <p>After reading all the short stories in this book I started to think that this book is just a collection of short stories Stephen King’s decided weren’t good enough but still decide to publish to get the paycheck from publishing this book.</p>
                    <p>All the short stories in this book were a 1 stars reads fro me personality. And most of them dragged for far too long than they needed to me. So I found myself so many times to just to be skimming through those short stories.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking for good horror short stories you will be much better of reading the “Goosebumps” books which are more better and much scarier than the short stories in this book.</p>
                    <p>To be honest he only “dark” things about the short stories in this book are how bad they are. Most of the short stories in this book give off the feeling that Stephen King is back to taking drugs and back to his problem with alcohol.</p>
